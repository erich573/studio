- Motivational Pixel-Art Tool: Generate unique pixel-art motivational messages based on user's task completion progress, providing encouraging visual feedback.

## Style Guidelines:

- Color Palette: Pastel scheme to evoke a soft, retro pixel art feel. Primary elements will use a gentle pastel blue (RGB: #A7D9FF) to highlight interactive components and headings. The background will be a light, calming pastel gray (RGB: #E0E0E0), providing a soft canvas for the pixel art aesthetic. A warm pastel peach (RGB: #FFDAB9) will serve as an accent, drawing attention to calls-to-action and key notifications.
- Body and Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) to complement the computerized and techy feel of pixel art. Its clean, geometric lines will ensure readability while aligning with the overall theme.
- All icons, including checkboxes, delete buttons, and other UI elements, will be custom-designed in a low-resolution pixel art style (e.g., 16x16 or 24x24 pixels) to reinforce the retro aesthetic.
- The layout will emphasize distinct, blocky sections with clear borders, reminiscent of older digital interfaces. Grid-based arrangements will be used to structure tasks, enhancing the pixel-art visual coherence.
- Interactions will feature subtle, instantaneous 'frame-by-frame' transitions or quick-appearing animations to simulate the feeling of older game graphics. For example, a task completing might involve a small, sprite-like visual effect.
